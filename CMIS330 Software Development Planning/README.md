# Software Design Documentation #

This Software Engr Prin Techniques class documentation from 2023, includes four standardized documents for software development. This includes a Software Test Specification (STS), Software Design Description(SDD), Software Requirements Sheet(SRS), and Software Development Plan(SDP). SRS is standardized from IEEE 830-1998, STS from IEEE 829-2008, SDP from IEEE-1058-1998, and SDD from IEEE 1016-2009. Learning outcome was to wholistically take in customer requirements and plan for its software system solution. This fictional scenario is to create a lodging software that can also process payments. Software is designed with an object oriented approach in layers of grouping like objects. Each document references other industry or legal documents to keep in mind (e.g. GDPR, PCI DSS).
