In these videos, I go over the notes I had to take for their respective certifications. I certified for them in 2024. GIAC Certified Incident Handler was easily the hardest certificate to go for given the depth of knowledge it goes into. The exam itself involved connecting to virtual machines and running some commands for analysis. Cyber Security Analyst was the next difficult since it is a step below the CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner(CASP) certificate. It came down to a lot of memorization of scenarios. Penetration Testing was the easier of the bunch for me as it revolved around tools. Getting to see or use most of the tools in action engaged my senses more for memory.
